# 4-Player-Project
Database: 
Data should now be correct, i only used rounds with all 4 players present, its nearly impossible (at least for me) to determine which player dropped out for 100%.
If you want to create the database:
- Change folder path in the database.py file
- Put .txt files into the same folder as the main.py and database.py files
- Change text file names in all "with open" lines.

Here the database file:
